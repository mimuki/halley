# msync_fzf

A fzf-based fedi timeline browser, for Mastodon and anything that supports the Mastodon API. Uses msync at <https://github.com/Kansattica/msync> for actual interaction, and fzf at <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf> for presentation: this repo is just a bunch of scripts to glue it all.

Hacked extensively to do strange things- features are duct taped on, and will break if you look at them funny. The original is <https://git.sr.ht/~rakoo/msync_fzf>, if you want that.

The icons assume you're using <https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette>, I haven't checked if all the ones i'm using are in the PUA or not. My bad.

## Screenshots

A picture is worth a thousands words, right

## Usage

```sh
> ./msync_fzf yourUsername@example.com
```

FZF launches with all statuses, last one at the bottom. Here's an example of line:

```
[1438] cw: crime Â· Rob Ricci
```

- an index that makes it easier to follow when updating the list
- the content warning, if there is one
- the author's nickname (the original has more info, but that's not my jam)


When a line is highlighted with fzf, the post is displayed in the preview window.

To interact with your instance, you need to install and use msync. This allows offline reading and queuing of interactions. To synchronize, run `msync sync`

## Bonus Features

Multi account support- you can browse the timeline of, boost, favourite, and sync a specific account, instead of every account you have set up with msync.

Boosted posts get filtered out, since they only show a link to the original post anyway.

Content warnings that hide the post by default! To see the post, wait 5 seconds and it'll display the contents.

Write posts & replies!

Various other little tweaks per my personal preference

### Shortcuts

- enter will open the link to the post in your browser
- F5 refreshes the list
- ctrl-p to write and queue a post
- ctrl-r to write and queue a reply to the selected post
- ctrl-b (changed from ctrl-u) to queue boosting a post
- ctrl-f (changed from ctrl-s) to queue favouriting a post
- ctrl-space to toggle the post preview (useful if the next post has a CW you don't want to open)
- ctrl-e to jump to oldest post
- ctrl-i to jump to newest
- shift-e to scroll preview down
- shift-i to scroll preview up

### Hack / To Be Hacked

The goal here is to use msync and fzf as workhorses, and glue them to fit my needs. Feel free to change it on your side and make it *yours*

Things that are interesting to dig:

- Add your own shortcuts, or change them by editing the source code directly

- Check out `preview.rc` to tweak what the preview window shows (enable favourites, change colours, that sort of thing)

- handle showing notifications, or making posts that mention you more prominent?

- I added multi account support, but why not default to the old behaviour if no account is given?

- there are ways to automatically download attached images, maybe do that and display them in a good way?

- there's a way with msync to request the context for a post, fetching the earlier posts in the thread when you sync next... that would be cool

- being able to reply is nice, but automatically setting the post privacy based on the original post would be nice

- browsing your queued posts, and being able to easily reply/edit/delete them?
